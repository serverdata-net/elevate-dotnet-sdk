# Elevate SDK for .NET
​
You can use this C# client library to integrate Elevate APIs into your application. To do this, you will need an Elevate account.
Before you start, we recommend that you visit our [Developer Portal](https://developer.elevate.services/).

## Targeted Frameworks
​
The SDK is compiled with .NET Standard 2.0 target. You can use the libraries with .NET 4.6.1 and above.
.NET Core is also supported starting from version 2.0. Learn more about the compatibilities at [Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard).
​
## Installation
​
The SDK consists of several packages, which are available at NuGet.
​
* ElevateUC.SDK.Voice provides the client for [Voice API](https://developer.elevate.services/api/spec/calling/index.html).
* ElevateUC.SDK.Meetings provides the client for [Meetings API](https://developer.elevate.services/api/spec/meeting/index.html).
* ElevateUC.SDK.Analytics provides the client for [Analytics API](https://developer.elevate.services/api/spec/analytics/index.html).
* ElevateUC.SDK.Address Book provides the client for [Address Book API](https://developer.elevate.services/api/spec/address_book/index.html).
* ElevateUC.SDK provides all functionality.
​
To install the C# client library with the full functionality using NuGet, run the following command from the terminal in your projects directory:
​
``` cmd
dotnet add package ElevateUC.SDK
```
​
Or run the following command in the Package Manager Console:
​
``` cmd
Install-Package ElevateUC.SDK
```
​
If you prefer to run commands directly from source:
​
* clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/serverdata-net/elevate-dotnet-sdk`;
* add the elevate-dotnet-sdk/ElevateUC.SDK.csproj file to your .sln file;
* add the elevate-dotnet-sdk/ElevateUC.SDK.csproj file as a project dependency.
​
```xml
<ItemGroup>
    <ProjectReference Include="../elevate-dotnet-sdk/ElevateUC.SDK.csproj" />
</ItemGroup>
```
​
Our experienced clients are recommended to install only the required libraries to decrease the size of an application result bundle. For example, if you are going to use the Analytics API, install Elevate.SDK.Analytics only.
​
## Supported APIs
​
Below is the list of Elevate APIs and the information on their support by Elevate .NET SDK.

|--------------------|:--------------------:|:-------------:|
| Meeting API        | General Availability |      ✅       |

| Contact Center API | In Development       |      ❌       |

## Authorization

Elevate uses JWT tokens to get access to the Elevate API. If you're going to use full SDK package we provide a generic `IAuthorizationTokenProvider` interface and `SimpleAuthorizationTokenProvider` class as default implementation. Our implementation is used for prototyping and examples. We strongly recommend to create own implementation of the interface.

If you want to use a specified package for an API you should to provide an authorization delegate

``` csharp
var token = "YOUR_JWT_TOKEN";
Func<string, Task<string>> tokenProvider = scope => Task.FromResult(token);
var unifiedClient = new AddressBookClient(tokenProvider);
```
You can use our ConnectSDK.Auth package to get the target token provider. Our implementation is used for prototypes and examples. We strongly recommend that you create your own implementation of the interface.

### Client Credentials Flow (S2S)

First, you need to create an instance of the ClientCredentialsConfiguration class:
``` csharp
var clientCredsConfig = new ClientCredentialsConfiguration(
    authBaseUrl: "AUTH_BASE_URL",
    clientId: "CLIENT_ID",
    clientSecret: "CLIENT_SECRET");
```
After this step is completed, you will be able to get the token provider and pass it to the API client:
``` csharp
var clientCredsTokenProvider = Authorization.BuildAuthorizationTokenProvider(clientCredsConfig);
var uniteClient = new UnifiedClient(clientCredsTokenProvider);
```

### Authorization Code Flow (Confidential Client)

First, you need to create an instance of the AuthorizationCodeConfiguration class:
``` csharp
var authCodeConfig = new AuthorizationCodeConfiguration(
    authBaseUrl: "AUTH_BASE_URL",
    clientId: "CLIENT_ID",
    clientSecret: "CLIENT_SECRET",
    redirectUrl: "REDIRECT_URL",
    deviceId: "DEVICE_ID");
```
You also need to obtain the authorization code yourself using the "/authorize" endpoint.
After this step is completed, you will be able to get the token provider and pass it to the API client:
``` csharp
var authorizationCode = "YOUR_AUTHORIZATION_CODE";
var authCodeTokenProvider = await Authorization.BuildAuthorizationTokenProvider(authCodeConfig, authorizationCode);
var uniteClient = new UnifiedClient(authCodeTokenProvider);
```

### Authorization Code Flow With PKCE (Public Client)

The token provider implementation of the Authorization Code Flow with PKCE is not supported in the current version of the ConnectSdk.Auth package.

### Authorization Router

If you want to use several different OAuth flows in your project, refer to the AuthorizationRouterTokenProvider class by passing token providers to it:
``` csharp
var tokenRouter = new AuthorizationRouterTokenProvider(clientCredsTokenProvider, authCodeTokenProvider);   
```
Afterwards, you will be able to pass them to the API client.
``` csharp
var uniteClient = new UnifiedClient(tokenRouter);
```

## Examples
​

{
    CallAttributes = new[] { "outbound" }
};

var devices = await callsClient.GetDevices();
var deviceId = devices.ClickToCallDevices[0].Id;
var phoneNumber = "5551000";
​
var makeCallBody = new MakeCallBody(deviceId, phoneNumber);
var makeCallResponse = await callsClient.MakeCall(makeCallBody);
```
​

Action<CallEvent> eventHandler = callEvent => 
    Console.WriteLine($"A call status for a call with {callEvent.CallId} was changed on {callEvent.EventType}");
​
var hub = callsClient.CreateSubscription(eventHandler);
```
